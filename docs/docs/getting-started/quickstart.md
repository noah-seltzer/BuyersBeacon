# Quick Start

## Running the Application

1. **From the root project directory (`BuyersBeacon`), run the development command:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This command starts both the client (`next dev`) and the server (`dotnet run`) concurrently.

2. **Access the client application** at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **The server API** will be running on a different port (check `server/Properties/launchSettings.json` or server console output).

## Basic Navigation

1. **Create an account or log in** using the authentication system.

2. **Create a beacon** by navigating to the beacon creation page.

3. **Browse existing beacons** to discover offerings from other users.

4. **Communicate with users** through the real-time chat feature.

5. **Leave reviews** for beacons you've interacted with.
