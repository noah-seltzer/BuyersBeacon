# Developing

Reccomended environment is wsl or linux.

If running on WSL, clone repo into home directory. Hot reloading may not work without it.

1. Ensure node is installed (>=20.9.0). A version manager like nvm is highly reccomended
2. Ensure dotnet is installed (9.0.1)
3. Install pnpm https://pnpm.io/installation
4. Open a terminal and cd into project directory and run `pnpm install`. 
5. Run `pnpm dev` This will start both the client and the server in the same terminal.
